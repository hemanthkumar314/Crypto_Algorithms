<h2>Crytpography</h2>
<br>
Cryptography is a technique of securing communication by converting plain text into ciphertext. It involves various algorithms and protocols to ensure data.
<br>
In Cryptography, the techniques that are used to protect information are done by algorithms to convert messages in ways that make it hard to decode them
<br>
<br>
There are mainly 3 types of Cryptography
<br>
1)Symmetric Crytpography
<br>
2)Asymmetric Crytpography
<br>
3)Hashing

<h3>Symmetric Cryptography</h3>

Symmetric Key cryptography is an encryption methodology where the sender and receiver uses a single common key to encrypt and decrypt messages.
<br>
The most popular symmetric key cryptography systems are Data Encryption Systems (DES) and Advanced Encryption Systems (AES).
<br>

<h4>Data Encryption Standard(DES)</h4>

Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a block cipher with a 56-bit key length that has played a significant role in data security.DES is a block cipher which encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bits each, where 64 bits of plain text go as the input to DES algorithm and produces 64 bits of ciphertext. The same algorithm and key(public) are used for encryption and decryption, with minor differences.

<h4>Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)</h4>

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a Block Cipher and key size can be 128/192/256 bits which encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits each.That means it takes 128 bits as input and outputs 128 bits of encrypted cipher text.The same algorithm and key(public) are used for encryption and decryption, with minor differences
